# LSTM-char-LM

Some of the code used for my master thesis project, "Deep Recurrent Neural Networks in character-level language modeling". The main training file was based on Søren Sønderby's pentree.py example: https://github.com/skaae/Lasagne/blob/f38227d075245c5b882cfe3d18bb6502b57e4ea6/examples/pentree.py
